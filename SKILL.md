# Authentic Storytelling

Transform any subject into a compelling human story by finding the real people and their true experiences behind abstractions.

---

## When to Use

- Writing about a business, organization, or cause
- Creating content that needs emotional resonance
- Turning dry facts into engaging narrative
- Documenting travel, food, or cultural experiences
- Making unfamiliar subjects accessible
- User asks "Find the human angle" or "Tell this story authentically" or "How do I make this compelling?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | What you're telling a story about |
| context | Yes | Who the audience is and what they need |
| access | No | What people/places/materials you can reach |
| constraints | No | Time, format, or other limitations |

## Bourdain's Storytelling Framework

Anthony Bourdain transformed food and travel television by treating every story as fundamentally about people. His approach rejects abstraction in favor of specificity, performance in favor of authenticity, and comfort in favor of truth.

### The Five Principles

**1. Lead with the Human**
Every story is about specific people, not abstractions. Not "Vietnamese cuisine" but "this grandmother who has made pho in this same spot for forty years." Not "corporate culture" but "the night janitor who's been here longer than the CEO."

*Questions to ask:*
- Who is the most interesting person connected to this subject?
- Whose hands actually do the work?
- Who has the story no one else is telling?

**2. Show, Don't Explain**
Maximum B-roll, minimum voiceover. Let the scene speak. Trust your audience to feel what's happening without having it explained.

*In practice:*
- Describe what you see, hear, smell, taste
- Let dialogue carry meaning
- Use silence instead of filling every gap
- Include details that seem unimportant but feel real

**3. Build Trust Before Filming**
The real story emerges only after defenses drop. "Time and alcohol" was Bourdain's formula. Spend time with people before you ask them to perform.

*In practice:*
- Don't rush to the "content"
- Share something of yourself first
- Eat together, if possible
- Let awkward silences happen

**4. Allow Uncomfortable Silences**
Reality isn't narrated. Real conversations have pauses, half-finished thoughts, moments where no one knows what to say. Including these creates authenticity.

*In practice:*
- Don't cut every pause
- Let emotion sit without commentary
- Trust the audience to feel with you

**5. Honor the Unseen**
"Put the people who would never be on camera, on camera." The dishwasher, the prep cook, the person who does the work that makes everything else possible.

*Questions to ask:*
- Who makes this happen that no one credits?
- Whose labor is invisible?
- Whose story would surprise people?

## The Authenticity Test

Before finalizing your story, ask:

| Question | If No, What to Do |
|----------|-------------------|
| Are there specific named people? | Go back and find them |
| Can you smell/taste/hear the scene? | Add sensory detail |
| Would the subject recognize themselves? | You've missed something—dig deeper |
| Is there anything uncomfortable or complicated? | You're probably sanitizing—include the mess |
| Did you include someone who's usually overlooked? | Find the invisible person |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Story Approach: [Subject]

### The Human Angle
[Who is the specific person/people at the center of this story?]

### The Scene
[What sensory details will immerse the audience?]

### The Honest Truth
[What's complicated, uncomfortable, or surprising about this?]

### The Unseen Story
[Who does the work that no one credits?]

### The Approach
[How will you build trust and capture authenticity?]

### Opening Image
[What's the first thing your audience sees/reads that pulls them in?]

### Closing Resonance
[What do you leave them with?]
```

## What This Skill Rejects

| Generic Approach | Bourdain Approach |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Company profile: "Founded in 1987, Acme Corp..." | The machinist who's been on the floor since 1987, what his hands look like |
| Travel piece: "Paris is known for its cuisine..." | One specific meal, one specific person, one specific moment |
| Feature story: "The trend of X is growing..." | One person living the trend, their actual daily life |
| Corporate content: "Our values include..." | The employee who embodies those values, what they actually do |

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I need to write about a local coffee roaster for a magazine."

**Generic approach:** History of the company, awards won, sourcing philosophy, quotes from the founder about quality.

**Authentic Storytelling approach:**

## Story Approach: [Name] Coffee Roasters

### The Human Angle
Maria, who works the 4 AM roasting shift. Came from Guatemala, where her family grew coffee but never roasted it. First time she saw beans turn from green to brown, she cried. Now she can tell you the exact moment a batch is done by the cracking sound—no timer needed.

### The Scene
The roastery at 4:30 AM. The machines haven't started yet. Maria checks the green beans, running them through her fingers like rosary beads. The smell: raw, vegetal, nothing like coffee yet. Then the first batch goes in, and within minutes the whole building smells like possibility.

### The Honest Truth
The job is brutal. Her hands are calloused, her sleep schedule is destroyed. She makes $18/hour. The "artisan coffee" that sells for $24/pound? She drinks Folgers at home—can't afford what she makes. She's not bitter about it, exactly. But when she describes the customers who tour the facility and ask ignorant questions, there's an edge.

### The Unseen Story
Maria, plus the truck drivers who deliver the green beans, the maintenance guy who keeps the 1970s roaster running, the part-time employees who bag and label.

### The Approach
Come at 4 AM. Bring my own coffee. Watch a full shift before asking questions. Ask to try roasting myself—my failure will make her feel expert, not observed.

### Opening Image
Maria's hands, brown and scarred, scooping green coffee beans before dawn.

### Closing Resonance
"When I'm gone, someone else will do this. The beans won't care. But I'll know that for ten years, every batch that left here, I put something into it. You can't taste it. But it's there."
